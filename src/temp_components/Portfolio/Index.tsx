They needed a scalable, user-friendly platform that supported both desktop and mobile users with features like product browsing, user reviews, secure checkout, and real-time inventory updates.
                              <br />
                              <b>Task:</b> I was responsible for building both the front-end and back-end components of the platform, ensuring seamless integration with the client's inventory and payment systems.

                              <br />
                              <b>Action:</b> Using React for the front-end, I designed a responsive and intuitive UI to enhance user engagement and ease of navigation. For the back-end, I developed RESTful APIs with Node.jsand MongoDB for robust data management. Additionally, I integrated the platform with AWS to optimize load times and set up a CI/CD pipeline for efficient deployment and testing. Collaboration with designers and QA ensured adherence to usability and accessibility standards.
                              <br />
                              <b>Result:</b> The project was completed on time, resulting in a 35% increase in online sales within the first three months.
